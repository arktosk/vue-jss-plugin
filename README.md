## Installation

Project was initially designed to be run over Node.js® 12.14.0 LTS, and that version is locked in `.nvmrc` file. There shouldn't be much troubles to run it on other version, but if there will be any please use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to switch to declared version of Node.js®.

```sh
npm install
npm run bootstrap
```
